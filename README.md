Homework 4 for CMPSC462

The robotech.txt file came from http://www.textfiles.com/stories/robotech

CMPSC462 is the first class where I started to use JetBrains' CLion IDE. I'm surprised at the boilerplate code generation. I had to lookup how my << operator overloading function worked for my Node class. I haven't used C++ since CMPSC 122 and haven't done a program as complex as this since High School. Maybe that new CMPSC330 class that I'm technically not required to take would've been nice.
